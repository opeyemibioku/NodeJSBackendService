## Overview

### This project is a Node.js application that implements user authentication and post creation functionality using Express.js, MongoDB, and JWT (JSON Web Tokens). It consists of two main controllers: authController for user authentication and postController for post creation. The controllers are integrated with corresponding routers, authRouter and postRouter, to handle HTTP requests.
